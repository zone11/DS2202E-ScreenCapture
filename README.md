# DS2202E-ScreenCapture
'DS2202E-ScreenCapture.py' is a Python script that captures whatever is displayed on the screen of a Rigol DS2202E series oscilloscope.

It can save data as a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) picture of the oscilloscope screen, or as a text file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.

To achieve this, SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) are sent from the computer to the oscilloscope, using the LXI (LAN-based eXtensions for Instrumentation) protocol over a Telnet connection.
The computer and the oscilloscope are connected together by a LAN (Local Area Network).
No USB (Universal Serial Bus), no VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture), no IVI (Interchangeable Virtual Instrument) and no Rigol drivers are required.
Python 2 is required. Python 3 is not supported.
